This is an app I built for the PBS POV hackathon. It is essentially a private scrapbooking site, where family and friends can come together to create a detailed timeline of a loved one's life by submitting stories, photos, videos or any other media that tell the story of that person's life.

It's built with C# .Net MVC, and angular.js for the front end framework.
